ORServices is a free, open source, smartphone-friendly directory application for health, human and social services that uses [Open Referral](http://openreferral.org/) data formats. Itâ€™s designed to be an easy to deploy, modify and maintain alternative to expensive proprietary nonprofit service directories often used by 2-1-1 systems in the USA.

You can use ORServices as an interface to manage all aspects of your service directory data, or you can manage your data using the [OR Airtable Template](https://airtable.com/universe/expwt9yr65lFGUJAr/social-services-directory-v20) and display it automatically via ORServices. We can also set up a custom publishing workflow for you whereby your data is [transformed](https://github.com/openreferral/hsds_transformer) from its existing format into an [Open Referralâ€™s Human Service Data Standard (HSDS)](http://docs.openreferral.org/en/latest/hsds/) zip file and regularly imported into an ORServices application.

Features include:
* Web and mobile-friendly, geo-aware directory software 
* Human Service Data Standard (HSDS) compliant data model
* Manage any facet of HSDS data within the app
* Create and manage users, and assign them the ability to manage contact, service, location and organization information on an organization by organization basis
* Content management system for customizing home and about pages, headers and footers, site colors, icons, images and logos.
* Location-aware search and filtering
* Manage multiple service taxonomies
* Download PDFs and CSVs of individual and filtered lists of services and organizations.
* Track and manage user data entry sessions
* Import data from Airtable, HSDS CSVs, HSDS Zip and HSDS Zip API
* Export data as HSDS CSV, HSDS Zip and HSDS Zip API
* Integration with Google Translate to offer contents in dozens of different languages.
* Integrate with Google Analytics for tracking user flows, usage statistics and more


### Installation

**ðŸ‘‰Server Requirements:**


The Laravel framework has a few system requirements. You will need to make sure your server meets the following requirements:

* PHP >= 7.2.5
* BCMath PHP Extension
* Ctype PHP Extension
* JSON PHP Extension
* Fileinfo PHP extension
* Mbstring PHP Extension
* OpenSSL PHP Extension
* PDO PHP Extension
* Tokenizer PHP Extension
* XML PHP Extension


**ðŸ‘‰ Web Server Configuration:**


*Apache*

`Pretty URLs`
Laravel includes a public/.htaccess file that is used to provide URLs without the index.php front controller in the path. Before serving Laravel with Apache, be sure to enable the mod_rewrite module so the .htaccess file will be honored by the server.

If the .htaccess file that ships with Laravel does not work with your Apache installation, try this alternative:

```bash
Options +FollowSymLinks -Indexes
RewriteEngine On

RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} .
RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^ index.php [L]
```

*Nginx*

If you are using Nginx, the following directive in your site configuration will direct all requests to the index.php front controller:

```bash
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
}
```

**ðŸ‘‰Configuration**
   * Run git clone https://github.com/sarapis/orservices.git
   * Create a MySQL database for the project
   * mysql -u root -p, if using Vagrant: mysql -u homestead -psecret    
   * From the projects root run cp .env.example .env
   * Configure your .env file
   * Run composer update from the projects root folder
   * Run npm install & npm run dev from the projects root folder
   * From the projects root folder run sudo chmod -R 755 ../orservices
   * From the projects root folder run php artisan key:generate
   * From the projects root folder run php artisan migrate
   * From the projects root folder run php artisan db:seed
   * From the projects root folder run composer dump-autoload
    
**ðŸ‘‰Database upload**
   * Create database and upload sql dump file from database/dump/latest_date.sql



**ðŸ‘‰Local Development Server**

* If you have PHP installed locally and you would like to use PHP's built-in development server to serve your application, you may use the serve Artisan command. This command will start a development server at http://localhost:8000:


```bash
php artisan serve
```

**ðŸ‘‰Deploy to Microsoft Azure (App Service Deployment)**

To deploy the application to Microsoft Azure (https://azure.com) follow the below steps. The guide assumes you have signed up for Azure account and have an active subscription.

*Create App Service* 
* Login to you Azure account and navigate to subscriptions page (https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade). Azure gives a Free Trial subscription on signup.
* Once you have confirmed you have an active subsctiption, create a resource group. A resource group is a container that holds related resources. Resources could be applications e.g App service, databases e.g Azure Database for MySQL. Here is a guide on creatign a resource group - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal#create-resource-groups
* Navigate to App Services (https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Web%2Fsites) and click the "+ Add" button
* Fill out the details and click "Review + create" button. Make sure to select the subscription you created ealier and the resource group. Provide the instance name (the name will form part of the application url e.g Naming your service orservices-test, the application will be accessible via https://orservices-test.azurewebsites.net/). For publish select "Code", Runtime stack - select PHP 7.4, Region - select any (tip: select the region where most of the users using your application are located), for Linux Plan - leave as default. For Sku and size, you can leave as default.

*Create SQL Database*
* Navigate to SQL Databases (https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Sql%2Fservers%2Fdatabases) and click "+ Add" button.
* Fill out the details and click "Review + create" button. Make sure to select the subscription you created ealier and the resource group. Provide the database name, for Server, click create new and fill out the pop out form with server name, server admin login, password and location. Its important to save these details somewhere since you will need them to connect the application to the database. For Want to use SQL elastic pool? - select No. For Compute + storage - leave as default or configure based on your needs.
