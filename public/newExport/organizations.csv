In so doing, we are committed to offering said services in a clean, safe environment, appropriate in meeting the healthcare needs of our target population. EECH also demonstrates social responsibility through the just use of resources. The commitment of our staff, physicians, volunteers, community partners and friends to our mission permits us to maintain a quality of presence and tradition of caring, which is a hallmark of EECH. Our History The Elaine Ellis Center of Health was founded in 2010 by the relatives of the late Elaine Ellis, who lost her battle with cancer in 1993. She was the matriarch of her family and a vibrant presence in her community. Her kindness and passion to serve others who were less fortunate extended beyond her family and friends to anyone who was in need of food, shelter, advice, and good conversation. Though she is unable to see the fruit which her character produced, her legacy continues, and is the driving force behind the Center’s mission to serve others.","elaineelliscenterofhealth@gmail.com","http://eechealth.com/","","","","","1","","1048984129419777,778121485505827,864041028832460,1134389546347902,891245636047663,953570402846759,1049005398980524","1268767777910385,859928595598571,838179226897828,1072565027493258",",1020706673677182,1114551742239605","0","","","","@eechealth","@eechealth","@eechealth",""

Education ACTS is the academic home for the disciplines of research education, training, and career development for the full spectrum of translational scientists. Through meetings, publications, and collaborative efforts, ACTS will provide a forum for members to develop, implement, and evaluate the impact of research education programs. Advocacy ACTS provides a strong voice to advocate for translational science, clinical research, patient oriented research, and research education support. We will engage at the local, state, and federal levels and coordinate efforts with other professional organizations.

Due to the pandemic, the Legal Clinic is not providing in person intake services at this time. Instead, they ask that clients, case managers, etc. reach out to the main line for confirmation of intakes and then conduct them via telephone with their volunteers. The Legal Clinic expects to go back to normal intake practices at some point within the next few months. When this occurs, , volunteers will obtain clients on a referral basis or at one of 7 intake sites run by the Legal Clinic at meal programs, health clinics, and day programs throughout DC. Volunteer attorneys participating in the project represent people on issues including: public benefits (e.g. food stamps and TANF); shelter and housing (e.g. shelter placement, conditions and expulsions, public housing, Housing Choice Voucher Program eligibility and terminations, and housing condition disputes); street rights; and consumer debt/credit.

CSOSA’s approach to community supervision emphasizes assessment, intervention, and accountability. In addition to the conditions of release imposed by the Superior Court for the District of Columbia (for individuals on probation) or the United States Parole Commission (for individuals on parole or supervised release), CSOSA develops an individualized supervision plan for each person entering supervision. Based on a comprehensive assessment, this plan identifies the person’s specific risk level and needs, as well as the specific program strategies that can be employed to meet those factors. This program strategy, coupled with stringent standards of contact and surveillance helps CSOSA protect the public and provide the men and women we supervise with the services they need to improve their lives.","contact@csosa.gov","https://www.csosa.gov/","","","","","1,4","","","","","","","","","","","",""
