We believe that happiness is built with small daily illusions, and with personal satisfaction. And then we focus on reinforcing the self-esteem of participants. On the other hand, we believe that being with friends doing all these things helps a person to feel better. Being able to share with other older adults and have a place where they feel welcome is an essential element in the elderly. That is why VIDA offers, in addition to all its classes, a whole package of recreation and socialization activities, such as walks, birthday celebrations, parties, group dances, and other activities and festivities that vary weekly. In summary, among the Education activities that we carry out regularly are the following classes:

• English for Beginners
• Intermediate English
• Literacy is Spanish
• Computing
• Embroidery
• Tissue
• Jewelry
• Singing
• Art / Painting
• Dance / Zumba

Among the recreational activities are the following:
• Birthday celebrations every month
• Bingo several times a week
• Out of center walks
• Daily monitoring of vital signs
• Diabetes Monitoring
• Weekly Chronic Disease classes in the Elderly

And being a poor older adult in Washington DC is a huge challenge, largely because of the price of rentals in the city. In addition, Hispanic older adults never knew about the social benefits offered by the federal or city government, and even when they know there is some benefit, it is difficult for them to apply for the benefit because they cannot read the documents that They explain the benefits, cannot fill out the forms, or do not know how to follow those procedures. To face this tangle of procedures, Vida has a Social Services Counselor. All participants of Vida Senior Centers receive help from our counselors to apply for affordable housing, transportation and social benefits for programs that benefit older adults. With regard to immigration procedures, VIDA not only helps participants to start and follow-up on their migration processes, but also offers a weekly “Citizenship Class” in which participants are prepared to take the Citizenship exam. We also connect them with the agencies that help them file their taxes and file legal procedures, if necessary. Likewise, VIDA is an official distributor of boxes of the Food Bank, and with this it helps to identify older adults at greater risk. So, in summary, when it comes to social services:

As part of the Health Promotion program, our counselors routinely check the participants who register daily: their pressure is measured; their blood sugar levels are monitored; and their vital signs are supervised. Due to the high preparation of our counselors, when it is detected that the participant requires a medical appointment, the participants are referred to an appointment with their primary doctor or the needed specialist, if the case requires so. VIDA works with 7 hospitals in the city to which our counselors refer the participants when necessary. If the participant needs it, our social service counselor helps the participant to make the medical appointment. Sometimes the language barriers require this type of support. We also have a medication monitoring program to teach participants to know the benefits and side effects of the medications they take, so that they can understand the impact of their medications and identify if there is a problem. As part of the “Medication Monitoring Program”, a personalized follow-up of each person who enrolls in the program is carried out and a medication organizer pill is provided free of charge, so that they learn to take their medications on time and also learn to realize when they forget to take their pills.

- Interview clients at home regarding legal problems;
- Draft or review legal documents that seniors may need, such as powers of attorney or wills;
- Administer a public-benefits checkup;

- Assist clients whose benefits or services have been threatened with termination, terminated, decreased or overpaid, through representation at all stages of the appeal process including personal conferences, requests for reconsideration, and fair hearings before the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH).

On the individual level, the prescription for achieving and maintaining health includes a lot: engaging in regular physical activity, maintaining proper hydration; eating nutritious meals that are appropriate for you, reducing stress, getting adequate sleep, and more. It is not easy.

There are factors we each face as unique individuals and others that we face as a community.

Similarly, nutrition is confusing and the food system is complex.  Some of our families struggle with food insecurity while others do not. Some individuals want to focus on cooking skills while others want a place to purchase produce. For these reasons, the Y’s food programs adopt community-specific programming that addresses the needs and desires of our families. We believe that by doing so we can make a change in our regional food system.

Participants are also educated on important issues related to nutrition such as: learning to keep food in good condition; modify recipes to make them healthier; improve decisions when buying food; use healthy portions of meals; and pay attention to their weight. They are often reminded of the importance of having breakfast and not skipping meals to avoid spikes and drops in sugar levels. In addition to that, VIDA gives breakfast to 50 participants in our two centers. We do not have a subsidy to provide breakfast, but for the past year VIDA has obtained private donations of bread and cereals that allow us to deliver breakfast in the morning to 50 people.

While eating or drinking
Anyone who has a breathing problem or health issue that would put their health at risk by wearing a cloth face covering.

1235579050212858,"Behavioral & Mental Health - Vida Senior Centers",,879684021850075,"When aging, it is sometimes inevitable that older adults have a life without much company. Sometimes this happens because of their children have other responsibilities as parents and have to take care of their own families. Also, in the case of older adults who are immigrants, when getting older they are disconnected from their networks and family members in their country of origin. In many cases, this isolation ends up generating chronic episodes of depression. Likewise, the life of the elderly is usually accompanied by many economic concerns, especially when it comes to immigrants with limited resources, who did not accumulate a sufficient pension to meet their basic needs. Not being able to pay the house bills or the costs of their health bills generates a lot of anxiety. In the case of most of our participants, who are first-generation immigrants, linguistic isolation is added to all of the above. Feeling that they cannot communicate well with the society that surrounds them or that they cannot function as they normally do is a very common stress generator in immigrants. To handle these situations, VIDA offers daily individual counseling and group counseling aimed at training older adults to manage stress and anxiety. We try to break the taboo barrier and understand that we all are exposed to situations of anxiety and that in the midst of problems, we must have tactics that help us relieve tensions. And to complement group and individual counseling, Vida also offers daily Tai-chi exercise classes, in which older adults learn to breathe and relax the tensions that manifest in their body. Vida Senior Centers puts special emphasis on mental health, because this can trigger other effects on the well-being of the person. When the situation requires the intervention of a doctor, Vida Senior Centers refers the participant to a specialized center. For this, VIDA has been coordinating with several local organizations specialized in mental health medical treatments. In summary, the activities offered as part of our Mental Health program are as follows:

• Individual counseling to handle stress situations
• Group counseling on frustration management techniques
• Tai-Chi exercises to learn to breathe and relax the body
• Classes on Positive Thinking
• Classes on Mental and Emotional Health
