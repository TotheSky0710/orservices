Through social interaction, mental challenges and physical activity, the Club seeks to maintain an intimacy and friendship that set it apart from other social day programs. Each member is treated as an individual and a sense of belonging to the Club is evident. Members find common ground and make friends.

This program’s goal is to help Medicare beneficiaries enroll into at least one of five “core benefits”, including: Medicare Part D Extra Help (Low Income Subsidy – LIS); Medicare Savings Programs (MSP); Medicaid; SNAP; and/or LIHEAP (Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program).  For this program, KCSC has partnered with the Chinese Culture and Community Service Center (CCACC) and the Association for Vietnamese Americans (AVA) enabling KCSC’s BEC to serve and provide bilingual and bicultural services to Korean, Chinese, and Vietnamese Medicare beneficiaries.

1317645687310954,,"Senior SNAP Enrollment Initiative","Since 2016, the National Council on Aging (NCOA) has funded Korean Community Service Center (KCSC) and its subcontractors, Chinese Culture and Community Service Center, Inc. (CCACC) and the Association for Vietnamese Americans (AVA), to educate the Asian community about the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). KCSC, CCACC, and AVA provide culturally/linguistically appropriate outreach and assistance to enroll/renew SNAP applications for Korean, Chinese, and Vietnamese beneficiaries. The Senior SNAP Enrollment Initiative specifically focuses on eligible seniors, aged 60+, residing in the Metropolitan Washington DC area including: Montgomery County and Prince George’s County in MD, Washington DC, and Fairfax County, Arlington County, Prince William County, Loudoun County, and the independent cities of Alexandria, Fairfax City, Falls Church, Manassas, and Manassas City Park in VA.  For those who are eligible, the rates of SNAP participation in the Metro DC are relatively low, ranging from 37.8% for VA (coming in 28th place among all US states) to 40.3% for MD residents (coming in at 19th place among all US states). For households that fall below 200% of FPL, Maryland has the nation’s 8th highest food insecurity rate among those who are 60+ (18.69%). While hard data is quite difficult to aggregate, anecdotally, we know that the SNAP participation rates among the Asian population are even lower as a result of cultural and linguistic barriers and the stigma associated with using SNAP.  Many elderly Asians are isolated and lack access to benefits such as SNAP. A lack of awareness of available services and resources, limited English proficiency, and significant cultural barriers cause many immigrants to underutilize crucial public benefits for which they are eligible. Misinformation about eligibility criteria, privacy concerns, and insecurities about immigration status are also major obstacles to accessing SNAP.  KCSC’s Senior SNAP service provides ongoing critically needed community outreach and education to counter misinformation and help those who are in need and eligible to enroll in SNAP and reduce their food insecurity."
