- Rent control disputes: we help you get the correct rent level under rent control, by helping you file forms and filing, defending against, rent control related petitions;
- Government subsidies: we help you prevent loss of your housing subsidy, including filing required paperwork for Section 8 vouchers, public housing and site-based subsidized housing;
- Repairs: we advocate for your right to live in a safe, well-maintained apartment, and to a rent credit for enduring those conditions;
- Reasonable accommodations: if you have a disability and need an accommodation to live in your apartment more comfortably, we can advocate for your apartment to better meet your needs;
- Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act: we work with tenants and tenants’ associations to help them exercise their right of first refusal of the purchase of their home, and to negotiate benefits in exchange for their right to purchase;
- Outreach and Education: we are glad to speak with community members about tenants’ rights and the rights of elderly tenants;
Policy advocacy to improve community responsiveness to elderly tenants, enhance affordable housing creation and preservation resources, and ensure accommodations for elderly tenants.

Social Work and Volunteer Assistance
- Assessment: of your full needs to ensure you are getting all of the services you need;

- Counseling of clients who experience grief, loss and other mental health challenges to remaining housed.

We welcome referrals from community agencies, property managers and other community members, upon signs of eviction risks, like:

Families apply for a voucher through the Montgomery County Housing Opportunities Commission (HOC), after experiencing homelessness. The families have moderate to high barriers which led to homelessness, e.g., multiple evictions, chronic homelessness, and serious health conditions. PBV allows children and their parents to live independently in Silver Spring apartments that are leased by NCCF. Families approved by HOC obtain a subsidized housing voucher for an unlimited amount of time, or until participants have sufficiently increased their income and no longer require a subsidy.

While participating in the PBV program, participants receive case management services through NCCF, community referrals/resources, and goal oriented Individual Service Plans to assist them in maintaining stable housing. PBV families benefit greatly from the NCCF hosted events such as the annual Domestic Violence Awareness Month, Family Services Holiday Party, and Santa’s Workshop. Participants rely on donations and volunteer services including food, clothing, furniture, household goods, toys, bikes, diapers, access to community events, and holiday celebrations.

Support and Inpatient Services
We recognize how challenging a child’s illness can be for the entire family, especially when parents cannot see what’s wrong. Mental illness and psychiatric conditions are particularly complex because there are many factors that may influence your child’s emotions and behaviors. As well, the signs and symptoms of a psychiatric condition are often different between younger children and teens.

Our multidisciplinary team is composed of pediatric psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, academic counselors, psychologists, and expressive (art) therapists, who see to all aspects of care. They have extensive experience in the specialized care and treatment of children and teens with complicated emotional and behavioral disturbances.

The inpatient unit was specifically designed to meet the developmental and psychiatric needs of children and adolescents. We offer two separate programs to meet the distinct medical needs of children and teens — a 12-bed unit for patients aged 2-12 and a 14-bed unit for those aged 13-17.

890516898015838,1121342754860910,,"Gender Development Program",,"A Multidisciplinary Program for Gender-Diverse Youth and Their Families 
Some young people feel, sense or know they are a gender different than the one they were assumed at birth. They may live and dress in ways typical of another gender (gender non-conformity), and some may experience the need to live and be affirmed as this gender in some or all settings. This can be an urgent need, or for others, there may be experimentation and exploration. There are also some young people who show gender non-conformity in their everyday behaviors, but may not yet have the self-advocacy skills to discuss their gender identity and their gender-related needs. Each child's gender journey is unique.

The gender development of a child may be confusing to parents and families, providers, and sometimes young people themselves. Parents may wonder:

How can my child's gender-related needs best be supported?
How do we navigate our child's gender diversity in everyday life (e.g., with family, in school, when moving into adulthood, etc.)?
Is my child transgender?
Will my child's gender and gender-related needs change over time?
The needs of gender-diverse youth are often complex, requiring a multidisciplinary team approach and ongoing care supports over time.

About Us
The Gender Development Program at Children's National has been supporting the gender needs of youth and their families for the past 20 years. As one of the earliest founded youth gender programs, we are a multidisciplinary team of specialists who work in the assessment and broad care needs of youth on the gender spectrum and their families. We also conduct cutting-edge research to move forward our understanding of youth gender development and ways to best support gender-diverse and transgender youth. Research findings inform all of our clinical care.

We work with gender exploring, gender non-conforming, gender dysphoric, gender non-binary, transgender and gender-questioning young people, and we see children and adolescents of all ages. We also work with youth who have genetic and other conditions in which gender variation is common.

We offer:

Personalized evaluations and tailored care: This includes evaluation of your child's gender development and needs in the real world. Throughout care with us, your child will receive supports tailored to their unique needs, in coordination with an existing community of professionals your child already sees to ensure continuity and consistency of care.
Comprehensive services and collaboration with multiple specialties: From initial and ongoing evaluation and support to specialists in medical treatments such as Veronica Gomez-Lobo, M.D., a pediatric gynecologist who provides medical interventions such as puberty suppression or hormone therapy, the program offers a full spectrum of care options based on the needs of each young person.
Unique programs for diverse needs:
Children and teens who have both autism spectrum characteristics (or related conditions) and gender dysphoria have access to a support program designed specifically for them: the Gender and Autism Program led by John Strang, Psy.D. Many providers refer patients to our program to access these services, which may not be offered elsewhere.
The Gender Development Program works closely with the Youth Pride Clinic, which offers primary and specialty care services to LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning/queer) patients.
Evaluation and Ongoing Supports
Your child’s care will start with an initial evaluation by our team. During this two to three-hour visit, you will meet the team together with your child and also separately. The goals of these visits vary from family to family and may include:

Understanding the various aspects of your child’s gender development
Screening for any mental health concerns/risks
Support for parenting a gender diverse child
Support for families navigating issues related to siblings, friends, school, etc.
We may ask you and your child to return for periodic follow-up visits. These visits can help us make a more extended evaluation. Your team also may suggest treatments or supportive services through Children’s National or in the community such as:

Individual supports for youth and/or parents
Family-specific supports

They also may result from a traumatic event.

Whatever the cause, we understand how stressful and confusing it can be when your young child is having trouble. We are here to help relieve these problems in children up to age 5, and prevent them from worsening as children grow up.

Why Choose Us
At the Infant and Toddler Mental Health Program (ITP) at Children’s National Health System, we diagnose personality and mood conditions early and design treatments specifically for your child. Features of our program include:

Unique, specialized psychiatric services for young children. We are one of only a few providers in the region specializing in psychiatric treatment for preschool-age children and in specialized therapies for this age group such as Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), a best practice therapeutic approach for young children with behavioral difficulties and their parents. Our feeding disorders clinic is one of only a few of its kind in the U.S. that specializes in treating infants and toddlers.
Compassionate, personalized care for each patient and family. Our Infant and Toddler Mental Health specialists consider each child’s individual situation and always treat you and your family as part of the team. We take the time to help you understand your child’s diagnosis and treatment and to answer any questions you may have. Our care supports your child’s emerging abilities and helps him or her grow into a healthy and happy child.
Internationally known for our results. The defining work on feeding disorders in young children was written by our director, Irene Chatoor, M.D.. Children who need specialized expertise and child-focused care are referred to us from the Washington, D.C., area, across the nation and around the world.
Close collaboration with skilled specialists. Our team works closely with a variety of specialists who add perspective to your child’s care. They can include occupational therapists and speech-language therapists, as well as experts from fields such as developmental psychology, developmental pediatrics, autism spectrum disorder and sleep disorders.
Specialized Care
Identifying mental health issues in children is complex. Children’s National offers two care paths that draw on multiple resources for your child.

Comprehensive Assessment and Intervention
Comprehensive assessment and intervention services help with a broad range of behavioral issues and stressful conditions that may affect infants through the first years of life. Parents or medical providers, may have concerns about:

Aggression
Anxiety
Exposure to loss
Feeding problems
Irritability
Moodiness
Neglect
Sleeping difficulties
Violence
Withdrawn behavior
You child’s first meeting with specialists may last up to two hours. It will include a psychiatric assessment. At that time we observe your child during a play session and cleaning up toys afterward. After this meeting, we give general feedback and advice for parents.

The underlying reasons for a child’s distress and/or behaviors can be complex.

A thorough evaluation usually requires at least three visits. Afterward we may recommend or provide:

Connections to school and community resources. We provide referrals for school-based services, such as DC Early Stages, Maryland Child Find, and Virginia Infants and Toddlers Connections. We also work with school administrators to help them provide services for your child. That can include letters of recommendation for school-based interventions, such as individualized educational plans (IEP), and referrals to educational advocates such as the Children’s Law Center.
Daycare or preschool consultations
Individual treatment strategies. This can include highly effective approaches such as parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT), which is provided by PCIT-certified therapist Leandra Godoy, Ph.D.. Applied behavioral analysis (ABA) can result in positive behavior changes in children with autism spectrum disorder. We also may recommend play therapy.
Medication, if needed. Some children benefit from medications focused specifically on their condition. Psychiatrist Bhavin Dave, M.D., can prescribe the right medication for your child and monitor how he or she responds.
Multidisciplinary care. We can connect you and your child with other providers, such as specialists in autism spectrum disorder, developmental psychology, developmental pediatrics, speech-language therapy, and occupational therapy. We may also refer your child to our Sleep Center.
Education for parents. Experts at Children’s National help parents understand how issues such as developmental delays and medical problems can lead to emotional or behavioral issues in young children. They also explain your child’s specific diagnosis and how it usually affects children as they grow.
Parenting support groups. Our parent support group gives parents an opportunity to share and learn from each other in an atmosphere of compassion, respect, confidentiality and mutual support.
Feeding Disorders
Our multidisciplinary feeding disorders team was established more than 15 years ago. Since then it has helped hundreds of families.

Feeding disorders in infants and young children under the age of 6 can come from a physical problem, an emotional issue or both. Assessment and care for infants and young children with these disorders can help them avoid health problems and improve their emotional well-being as they grow. Feeding disorders can include:
Overeating
Refusing to eat
Aversions to specific foods
Spitting up or vomiting in infants
Difficulty sucking or swallowing in infants
Gastro-esophageal reflux
Children with these problems may weigh too much or too little, or be normal weight. Infants may fail to gain weight and thrive. Older children may fall behind the normal growth curve.

New patients are first seen by a nurse specialist in gastroenterology. This nurse will consider your child’s medical, behavioral and nutritional issues. We also look at how well your child can control his or her lips, tongue and jaw muscles (oral-motor development). This screening will include a physical exam.

After the initial report from the nurse specialist, your child will have visits with specialists in several areas of care relevant to his or her condition. We may look further into his or her oral-motor and psychiatric issues. At this time, we will observe your child from behind a one-way mirror as he or she eats and plays.

Once we complete the comprehensive evaluation, the entire team meets with you to provide feedback. Our recommendations can include:

Guidance for parents in feeding management

Oral-motor therapy

Mood disorders can have wide-ranging effects on children, teens and their families. The toll on their physical health, performance in school, family and social relationships and overall well-being can be devastating.

Helping Children and Teens with Mood Disorders
The Mood Disorders Program at Children’s National Health System is dedicated to helping children and teens with mood disorders live as happily and healthfully as possible. We personalize care for each patient and family to ensure children receive the most appropriate treatment with the best outcomes.

Features of our program include:

Expert pediatric specialists. When a child or teen’s negative feelings don’t go away, our highly trained pediatric specialists have the expertise and experience to recognize mood disorders and provide the care they need. That includes pediatricians, counselors, social workers, psychiatrists and others.
Family-centered care. Our multi-specialty team knows that you know your child best. We value your input and work closely with your family to include you as a part of your child’s care team. This ensures he or she receives the most comprehensive and individualized care.
Ongoing support and education. We strive to empower preteens and their families diagnosed with mild to moderate depression to learn about the disorder that is impacting their lives. Group sessions that include art therapy and other tools help you work together toward recovery and wellness.
Finding new ways to help. Learning more about the factors that can lead to depression and other mood disorders in school-age children can improve their treatments and outcomes. Our researchers are committed to discovering new ways to identify, prevent and treat these disorders. Some of our patients participate in clinical trials. You can find out more by speaking with your child’s doctor, nurse, or other care team member.
Conditions We Treat
At Children’s National, we treat a wide range of mood disorders, including:

Major depression. A serious condition that involves persistent sadness, hopelessness and other symptoms
Bipolar disorder. A type of depression that also includes severe mood changes to extreme elation and happiness
Dysthymic disorder. Depression that is less severe but more long-lasting than major depression
Anxiety disorder. Excessive worry that doesn’t get better and can interfere with daily activities
Children and teens with mood disorders may have:

Difficult relationships with family and friends
Trouble sleeping
Changes in eating patterns or weight
Extreme temper outbursts
Low energy
Poor concentration
Aggressive behaviors
Mood disorders can cause other symptoms as well. Parents are in a unique position to see behavior changes and problems in their children. We take your concerns seriously and listen carefully to your observations.

Services We Offer
We start with a thorough evaluation, which can last two sessions or more, depending on your needs. Your pediatric specialist will talk with you about your child’s symptoms, your family health history and any other psychological concerns you may have. To give us more details about your child’s condition, we may ask your family to fill out forms known as objective scales. In some cases, teachers are also asked to complete these scales.

With an accurate diagnosis, we design a specific plan to provide the best care for each child. Follow-up care may involve:

Individual therapy
Family therapy
Medication, when necessary
We want you to be confident in your child’s care. To that end, we also provide second opinion evaluations and consultations.",https://childrensnational.org/departments/mood-disorders-program,,inactive,,"We see children and teenagers from the Washington, D.C., metropolitan region and across the nation.

At each clinic, the active intake attorney and her volunteers meet individually with seniors present to complete a ""Legal Health Assessment,"" which pinpoints areas in which each participant may require legal assistance. Then after conducting a conflicts check, we schedule in-office appointments for clients whom we met in the field and require ongoing legal help. Cases requiring extended legal representation are referred to LCE's Pro Bono Project for referral to a volunteer attorney in the District of Columbia.

The Active Intake Project handles civil cases for eligible clients in the following areas: Medicare/Medicaid, debt collection relief, landlord/tenant matters, public benefits, consumer fraud, powers of attorney for health care and finance, and wills.",https://www.aarp.org/legal-counsel-for-elderly/what-we-do/info-2017/active-intake-project.html?intcmp=AE-LCE-WWD-R1C1LL1,,inactive,,"Call for information",,,,

LAYC recruits and trains English and Spanish-speaking individuals and families as host families to provide youth with safe, loving, and stable homes. As part of this program, biological families receive family preservation services.

FAMILY PRESERVATION (SHORT-TERM ONLY)
The goal of family preservation is to reunite youth with their families. Our staff makes every effort to mediate temporary conflicts that do not pose a long-term threat to the youth’s safety. Our staff provides in-home family counseling, parent skills development, and mental health treatment to youth. We work with families who may be experiencing difficulties with adolescent behavior problems and mental health concerns as well as the effects of abuse or neglect, trauma, and poverty. We typically work with the families of youth at risk of running away or who have run away and are housed with one of our host families for five weeks.

LONG-TERM (UP TO 18 MONTHS)
Our long-term program helps older homeless youth, 18-21, transition to adulthood in a loving home. Once a youth is placed in the home of a certified family, the program provides supportive services to the youth, the host family, and the youth’s biological family. These services include crisis intervention; individual, group, and family counseling; mental health assessments; advocacy; referrals; intensive case management; and transportation.",http://www.layc-dc.org/what-we-do/safe-housing/family-based-housing/,tlphh@layc-dc.org,inactive,,"REQUIREMENTS FOR YOUTH IN OUR FAMILY-BASED HOUSING PROGRAM
